### Bearing Issues
When motor bearings fail, several sensor readings are typically affected:
- Vibration: A significant increase in vibration levels is one of the earliest and most noticeable signs of bearing failure. Sensors may detect irregular or high-frequency vibrations caused by misalignment, pitting, or spalling in the bearings.
- Temperature: Bearing failure often leads to increased friction, which generates heat. Temperature sensors may show a rise in motor or bearing housing temperatures.
- RPM (Rotational Speed): While RPM may not always be directly affected, severe bearing damage can cause fluctuations or instability in rotational speed due to uneven load distribution.
- Power Consumption: As bearings degrade, the motor may require more power to overcome the increased friction, leading to higher energy consumption. Power sensors may detect this change.

### Overheating: 
Excessive heat can damage insulation and internal components, often caused by overloading, poor ventilation, or high ambient temperatures.
### Electrical Overload: 
When the motor draws more current than it is designed for, it can lead to overheating and damage. This may result from excessive load, low voltage, or short circuits.

### Insulation Breakdown: 
Degraded insulation can lead to short circuits or electrical leakage, often caused by contamination, aging, or overheating.
###Vibration: 
Misalignment, imbalance, or loose components can cause excessive vibration, leading to wear and tear.
### Contamination: 
Dirt, dust, or moisture entering the motor can damage internal components and reduce efficiency.
### Power Supply Issues: 
Voltage imbalances, surges, or poor-quality power can strain the motor and cause failures.
### Mechanical Failures: 
Problems like misaligned shafts, broken couplings, or worn-out parts can disrupt motor operation.
### Rotor or Stator Damage: 
Physical damage to the rotor or stator can result in reduced performance or complete failure.
