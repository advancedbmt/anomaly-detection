🧠 Interpretation:
High accuracy (99%) is misleading since the model never detected any of the known anomalies.

Recall = 0.00 for anomalies → ❌ missed all anomaly cases.

Precision for anomalies = 0.00 → model didn’t predict any anomalies correctly.

F1-score = 0.00 for anomalies → severe failure in detecting true positives.

⚠️ Conclusion:
The AutoEncoder in its current configuration is not effective for detecting anomalies in this dataset. It behaves similarly to PCA and Elliptic Envelope:

All anomalies are missed.

The model likely overfits the normal pattern and underestimates deviations
