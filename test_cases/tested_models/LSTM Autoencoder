📈 Model Evaluation:
Precision (Anomalies): 0.012 → ❌ very low

Recall (Anomalies): 0.800 → ✅ high recall

F1-score: 0.023 → ❌ due to many false positives

Overall accuracy: 95% → ✅ but misleading because of imbalance

💡 What This Means:
High recall = good at catching real anomalies (✅).

Low precision = catches too many normal values as anomalies (❌).

So while it’s very sensitive, it may cause a lot of noise in production unless refined.
