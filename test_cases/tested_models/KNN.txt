🧠 Interpretation:
High Recall = All 15 anomalies were detected ✅

Very Low Precision = The model incorrectly labeled 187 normal points as anomalies ❌

F1-Score (True) = 0.14 → quite poor

🧩 Conclusion:
The model is very sensitive — it’s great at finding anomalies (recall = 1.00),
but not smart at filtering false positives (precision = 0.07).
Basically: "Shoot everything, hit a few."
