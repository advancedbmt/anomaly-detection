🔍 Interpretation:
High False Positives: 3,114 normal points were incorrectly marked as anomalies.

Zero True Positives: The model didn’t catch any actual anomalies.

🧠 Summary:
❌ Precision = 0.00 → It marked many points as anomalies, but they were wrong.

❌ Recall = 0.00 → It didn’t catch a single real anomaly.

✅ High Accuracy (85%) is misleading due to class imbalance — very few anomalies exist.
