📌 Interpretation
Perfect Precision on Normal Data (✅): Model never falsely predicted anomalies.

Zero Recall on Anomalies (❌): Model missed all 15 actual anomalies.

F1 Score (❌): For the anomaly class, F1 is 0.00, indicating it failed completely at detecting true anomalies.


⚠️ Conclusion
High Precision (for normal data) = Model is extremely conservative.

Zero Recall (for anomalies) = Model is not detecting actual issues.

Overall: PCA is not suitable in this case. It's too "safe" and avoids labeling anything as an anomaly.


✅ Summary (in your preferred style):
High Precision = model perfectly avoided false alarms on normal data (✅ good).
Zero Recall = model failed to detect any of the 15 true anomalies (❌ critical failure).

Conclusion: PCA is too conservative and cannot be trusted for anomaly detection in this case.
