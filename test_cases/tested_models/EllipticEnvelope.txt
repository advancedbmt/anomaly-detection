📊 Interpretation
Perfect Accuracy, but only because the model never predicted any anomalies.

False Negatives = 15 (missed all anomalies) ❌

True Positives = 0 — meaning 0 anomalies were correctly detected ❌

⚠️ Final Conclusion:
High Precision (for normal class) ✅

Zero Recall for anomaly class ❌

Model is completely ignoring anomalies. This is worse than random guessing for anomaly detection.
