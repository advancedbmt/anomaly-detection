based on the first sensor "power" here are the results:
Accuracy Metrics
True Anomalies (Support): 15

True Positives: 0

False Positives: 199

True Negatives: 19932

False Negatives: 15

Recall = 0.00 → No anomalies were detected (❌ very bad).

Precision = 0.00 → The model predicted 199 anomalies, but none were correct (❌ unacceptable).

High Specificity = 99.00+% → It correctly labels normal values (✅ decent for normal class).

🧠 Conclusion
❌ The model is completely ineffective for detecting anomalies in the power sensor.
It confidently marks many false alarms while missing all the real ones.
